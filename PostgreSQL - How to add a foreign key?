PostgreSQL - How to add a foreign key?
August 2, 2018

You have two tables:

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name TEXT
);
and

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL,
    dish_name TEXT,
    customer_id INTEGER
);
And you want to make customer_id from orders refer to id from customer.

There are a couple ways to do that.

1. Define the foreign key inside the CREATE TABLE statement

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL,
    dish_name TEXT,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers (id)
);
2. Use a separate ALTER TABLE statement

ALTER TABLE orders
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customers FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (id);
3. Use TableP lus GUI tool for Postgres

You can create a foreign key directly from the GUI Tool.
Select to view table orders from the right sidebar
Switch to structure tab at the bottom bar
Choose customer_id column and add a foreign key in the foreign_key field.
Remember to press Cmd + S to commit the changes to the server.
