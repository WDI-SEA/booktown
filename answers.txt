2. Get the COUNT of all Locations

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subjects GROUP BY subjects.location ORDER BY COUNT(*);

3. Get the COUNT of each unique location in the subjects table. Display the count and the location name. (hint: requires GROUP BY).

SELECT location, COUNT(*) FROM subjects GROUP BY subjects.location;

4. List all books. Display the book_id, title, and a count of how many editions each book has. (hint: requires GROUP BY and JOIN)

SELECT books.id, books.title, COUNT(editions.book_id) FROM books INNER JOIN editions
