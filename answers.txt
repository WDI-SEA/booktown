Order
1. SELECT subject FROM subjects ORDER BY subject;
3. SELECT subject FROM subjects ORDER BY location;

2. SELECT * FROM books WHERE title ILIKE '%Python%';
3. SELECT * FROM subjects WHERE location ILIKE '%Main St%' ORDER BY subject ASC;  

Joins
1.

  WHERE subjects.subject ILIKE ‘%computer%’;
2.
Select books.title, authors.first_name, authors.last_name, subjects.subject FROM books
INNER JOIN authors
  ON books.author_id = authors.id
INNER JOIN subjects
  ON books.subject_id = subjects.id;
3.
SELECT books.title, stock.retail FROM stock
  INNER JOIN editions
    ON editions.isbn = stock.isbn
  INNER JOIN books
    ON editions.book_id = books.id
  ORDER BY stock.retail DESC;

Grouping and Counting
1. 
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM books

2.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT subjects.location) FROM subjects;

3. 
SELECT location, COUNT(location) 
FROM subjects
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(location) > 0;

(another method:)

SELECT subjects.location, COUNT(subjects.location) 
FROM subjects
WHERE subjects.location IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY subjects.location;

4.
SELECT books.id, books.title,
COUNT(editions.edition)
FROM books
INNER JOIN editions
  ON editions.book_id = books.id
GROUP BY books.id, books.title;
